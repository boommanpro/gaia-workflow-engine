A modern visual rule engine platform for orchestrating complex AI workflows. Design, test, and deploy AI pipelines on an infinite canvas — no code required. Combines the power of [flowgram.ai](https://flowgram.ai) with a Java backend for production-ready workflow management.

## ✨ Features

- **Visual Canvas** — Infinite, zoomable canvas with drag-and-drop nodes. Supports loops, branches, and conditional logic.
- **AI Node Types** — Built-in LLM calls, code execution, HTTP requests, string formatting, and variable management.
- **Real-time Preview** — Test individual nodes or entire workflows with live input/output inspection.
- **Version Management** — Every save creates a version. Switch, track, and roll back with one click.
- **Template System** — Create reusable workflow templates. Spin up new workflows in a single click.
- **Extensible Plugins** — Minimap, auto-layout, snap lines, node panel, and more.
- **Multi-condition Node** — Synced from official flowgram.ai for complex branching logic.
